# My understanding of Node.js {#understanding}

## What is node.js
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js)
: Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting.

From what I understand from reading up, Javascript is mostly used in making interactive and dynamic websites. While node.js is a console focused, back-end runtime that lets you run server-side JavaScript outside of a web browser. I think that it is important to differenciate node.js from pure js, as they "serve different purposes in the web development ecosystem." [^1]

## Why use node.js
According to [miquido](https://www.miquido.com/blog/why-use-node-js/), node.js is not only scalable, fast, efficient, cross-platform adaptable, high performance and easy to learn. The node.js community is also huge, allowing for many innovative creations, tutorials, blogs, and creative codebases.
Learning node.js can also carry over into many different frameworks and applications.

## Logging, Variables, and If Else Logic
One of the most important building blocks of code and programs are *Logging, Variables, and If Else Logic* 
While writing code with these in them may seem easy, i think mastering the use of them efficiently may need some practice.
### Logging
As i have prior experience in [Python](https://www.python.org/), this instantly makes me think of:
´´´ruby
print("hi")
´´´
While javascript(the language of node.js) is a different language, the syntax is similar, lower level languages like C++.
In js(javascript), outputing a value to the console is as simple as calling the "console.log()" method:
´´´ruby
console.log("hi");
´´´
